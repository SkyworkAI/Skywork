To make this easier, we can get rid of the fractions by multiplying everything by 15. This gives us: 5x - 450 = 3x. This simplifies to 2x = 450, when we subtract 3x from both sides. Then we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2. This gives us x = <<450/2=225>>225. So, the toy store had 225 toys to start with. #### 225"}

We can write that like this: Cows + Chickens = <<22=22>>22 and 2*Cows + Chickens = <<64/2=32>>32. We can figure out how many cows there are by subtracting the total number of animals (22) from the half total number of legs (32). So, the number of cows is 32 - 22 = <<32-22=10>>10.

It's given that there are 60% more boys than girls, which means B = 1.6G. The total number of students is 180, which is equal to the boys plus the girls or B + G = 180. We can replace B in the second equation with 1.6G from the first equation to get: 1.6G + G = 180. Simplify that to 2.6G = 180. To find the number of girls, divide 180 by 2.6 to get G = <<180/2.6=69.23>>69.23, but we round it down to 69 because we can't have a fraction of a student. To find the number of boys, we multiply 1.6 by 69 to get B = <<1.6*69=110.4>>110.4, but we round it up to 111 because we can't have a fraction of a student.

From the problem, we know two things: 1. Jonathan is 5 years older than Lily. This means J = L + <<L+5=5+L>>5. 2. In 4 years, Jonathan will be twice as old as Lily. This means J + <<J+4=4+J>>4 = 2 * (L + <<L+4=4+L>>4). Now, let's solve this. By replacing the value of J in the second equation, we get (L + <<L+5=5+L>>5) + <<5+4=9>>9 = 2 * (L + <<L+4=4+L>>4). This simplifies to L + <<L+9=9+L>>9 = 2L + <<2*L+8=8+2*L>>8. If we subtract L from both sides, we get 9 = L + <<L+8=8+L>>8. Subtract 8 from both sides, we get L = <<9-8=1>>1. Now that we know Lily's age, we can find out Jonathan's age by replacing L in the first equation: J = L + <<L+5=5+L>>5. So, J = <<1+5=6>>6. So, Jonathan is 6 years old. #### 6"}

Over the weekend, he reads 20 pages plus extra 10 pages for 2 days, that's (20 pages + 10 pages) x 2 days = <<(20+10)*2=60>>60 pages. If we add together the pages he reads during both weekdays and weekends, we get 100 pages + 60 pages = <<100+60=160>>160 pages read in a week. The book is 300 pages, so if we divide the total pages by the number of pages he can read in a week, we get 300 pages ÷ 160 pages per week = <<300/160=1.875>>1.875 weeks. Since Peter cannot read for a fraction of a day, we round 1.875 weeks up to 2 weeks to finish the book. Two weeks equal 14 days, so if we subtract 1 day since today is Monday and he will read 20 pages today, we get 14 days - 1 day = <<14-1=13>>13 days.

Now, she sells 3/5 of her cupcakes, so we need to do 3/5 times 60 to find out how many cupcakes she sells. That's 3/5 * 60 = <<3/5*60=36>>36 cupcakes sold. Each cupcake costs $4, so to find out how much money she makes, we need to multiply the number of cupcakes sold by the cost of each cupcake. So it's 36 cupcakes times $4 each, which equals 36 * 4 = $<<36*4=144>>144. So Samantha makes $144. #### 144"}

First, we figure out how much the pennies are worth which is 50 pennies times 1 cent which gives us 50*1=<<50*1=50>>50 cents. Next, we figure out how much the dimes are worth which is 40 dimes times 10 cents that gives us 40*10=<<40*10=400>>400 cents. Lastly, we figure out how much the quarters are worth which is 30 quarters times 25 cents that gives us 30*25=<<30*25=750>>750 cents. Now, we add all these together: 50 cents from pennies, 400 cents from dimes, and 750 cents from quarters to get a total of 50+400+750=<<50+400+750=1200>>1200 cents. But we usually talk about money in dollars, not cents. So, if 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert 1200 cents into dollars by dividing it by 100.

{"text": "Alice started out with $30 and bought 3 books that cost $5 each. She also bought some pens that cost $2 each and she had $6 left over. So how many pens did she buy? Let's start by calculating how much Alice spent on the books. Since she bought 3 books at $5 each, that means she paid 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 for the books. We then subtract what she spent on books from her starting amount, that's 30-15, which equals $<<30-15=15>>15. This is the amount she could spend on pens. Since each pen costs $2, we divide 15 by 2 to figure out how many pens she bought. However, 15/2 = 7.5 and Alice can't buy half a pen, so she must have bought 7 pens. Next, we need to double-check our answer by adding up the total cost of the pens and books and making sure it matches up with how much Alice had before she had $6 left. The total cost for pens is 7*2, which equals $<<7*2=14>>14. And we already know the books cost $<<3*5=15>>15. Adding those two together, we get 14+15, which is $<<14+15=29>>29. If we subtract that from the $30 Alice started with, we get 30-29, which leaves $<<30-29=1>>1. But Alice had $6 left, so she must have bought less pens. That means we need to subtract $1 from the $15 Alice could have spent on pens, resulting in 15-1=<<15-1=14>>14. And if we divide that by the cost of each pen, we get 14/2, which equals 7.

Since half of the fish are goldfish, we will divide the total number of fish, which is 25, by 2. So, 25 divided by 2 is <<25/2=12.5>>12.5. But we can't have half a fish, so we round down to 12 goldfish. The rest of the fish are guppies. To find out how many guppies there are, we subtract the number of goldfish from the total number of fish. So, 25 minus 12 is <<25-12=13>>13. Tom has 13 guppies. #### 13"}

We can find this by calling the number of adults tickets sold A and the number of kids tickets sold C. We know two things from this: 1) A + C = <<A+C=250>>250 because that's how many tickets were sold. 2) 5A + 3C = <<5A+3C=950>>950 because that's how much money was made from selling the tickets. We can solve these step by step: First, multiply the first bit by 3 so that C is the same in both parts: 3A + 3C = <<3A+3C=750>>750. Second, take the new part from the second part: 5A + 3C - (3A + 3C) = 950 - 750. This gives us 2A = <<2A=200>>200. Finally, divide by 2 to find A: A = 200 / 2.

She sold dolls and cars which are 1/5 and 1/10 of the total sales respectively. She sold 50 * 1/5 = <<50*1/5=10>>10 dolls and 50 * 1/10 = <<50*1/10=5>>5 cars. So, she sold a total of 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 dolls and cars. The rest of the toys sold were action figures. To find out how many action figures she sold, we subtract the total dolls and cars from the total toys. So, 50 - 15 = <<50-15=35>>35 action figures were sold. So, Amy was able to sell 35 action figures. #### 35"}

But, we can't have half an apple rotten, so let's say 5 apples are rotten. So, how many good apples are left? We subtract the rotten ones from the total. That's 30 apples - 5 rotten apples = <<30-5=25>>25 good apples. Now, let's see how many oranges have gone bad. We do this by multiplying the total oranges by 25% or 0.25. That's 40 oranges * 0.25 = <<40*0.25=10>>10 rotten oranges. To find the good oranges, we subtract the rotten ones from the total. That's 40 oranges - 10 rotten oranges = <<40-10=30>>30 good oranges. Now, add the good apples and good oranges together to find the total good fruits. 25 good apples + 30 good oranges = <<25+30=55>>55 good fruits. So, we have 55 good fruits in the basket. #### 55"}

First, let's figure out how much they're making every hour. They earned $1000 in 2 hours so that's $1000/2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 bucks every hour. Now, let's see how much money they still need to make. They're aiming for $5000 and have already earned $1000, so, they still need to make $5000 - $1000 = <<5000-1000=4000>>4000 dollars.

If Hannah swam for 3 miles and Isaac finished his part in 9 minutes, how long did it take for Hannah to finish her part? First, we need to find out how long it took Isaac to swim each mile. We do this by dividing the total time he swam, which is 9 minutes, by the distance he swam, which is 1 mile. So, 9 minutes / 1 mile = <<9/1=9>>9 minutes/mile. Since Hannah is slower than Isaac, she took longer to swim each mile. In fact, she took three times as long as Isaac per mile. So, 9 minutes/mile * 3 = <<9*3=27>>27 minutes/mile. Now that we know how long Hannah took per mile, we multiply that by how many miles she swam, which is 3 miles. So, 27 minutes/mile * 3 miles = <<27*3=81>>81 minutes. Hannah took 81 minutes to finish her part of the race. #### 81"}

So, each person got 30 hours * $10/hour = <<30*10=300>>300 dollars every week. If we think about a month as 4 weeks, then each person got $300/week * 4 weeks/month = <<300*4=1200>>1200 dollars every month. That means the company paid $1200/month * 50 people = <<1200*50=60000>>60000 dollars to all the workers in July. In August, 1 out of every 5 people left.

Let's find out how many students were in class that day. First, we need to divide the total number of students, 45, by 2 to see how many are boys and how many are girls. But 45 divided by 2 is <<45/2=22.5>>22.5 and we can't have half a student, can we? So, there might be a mistake in the question. Let's assume there are actually 46 students, 23 boys and 23 girls. Now, 20% of the boys were absent, which is <<23*20/100=4.6>>4.6 boys, but we can't have 0.6 of a boy, so we round it up to 5 boys. Likewise, 15% of the girls were absent, which is <<23*15/100=3.45>>3.45 girls, but we can't have 0.45 of a girl, so we round that down to 3 girls.

{"text": "Cara, Asher, and Levi together scored 60 points in a basketball game. Cara scored 15 more points than Asher and the same amount as Levi. How many points did Asher score? To find the answer, we add the points Cara scored to the points Asher scored, and the points Levi scored. We know that Cara scored 15 more points than Asher, and the same amount as Levi, so we can say that Asher's score plus 15 (Cara's score) plus another score equal to Asher's (Levi's score) equals 60. So we have a simple equation: <<15+Asher's score+Asher's score=60>>15+Asher's score+Asher's score=60. We can simplify this by adding Asher's score to itself, which is the same as multiplying it by 2: <<15+2*Asher's score=60>>15+2*Asher's score=60. We can move the 15 to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from 60, which gives us 45: <<60-15=45>>45=2*Asher's score. Now we just need to divide 45 by 2 to find Asher's score: <<45/2=22.5>>22.5. But scores in basketball are always whole numbers! There seems to be a mistake. If we think about it a little more, we remember that Cara scored the same amount as Levi, not 5 more. So the equation should be: <<15+Asher's score+Asher's score=60>>15+Asher's score+Asher's score=60. If we solve this equation, we find that Asher's score is <<15=15>>15.

We're going to call the width 'w' and the length, which is twice the width, '2w'. The total of all the sides (which is the perimeter) is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.

If we solve 36 = 6w for 'w', we find that w = 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 cm, which is the width of the rectangle. Since the length is twice the width, the length is 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 cm.

{"text": "The football team scored 5 touchdowns, 3 field goals, and 2 safeties. Touchdowns are worth 6 points each, field goals are worth 3 points each, and safeties are worth 2 points each. Let's figure out the total score. First, let's calculate the points from touchdowns: 5 touchdowns times 6 points each gives us 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 points. For field goals, they made 3 field goals, with each one being 3 points, so that's 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 points. For safeties, they scored 2, and each one is 2 points, so that's 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 points. Now, add up all those points: 30 (from touchdowns) + 9 (from field goals) + 4 (from safeties) = <<30+9+4=43>>43 points. And that's the team's total score! #### 43"}

So, 800 miles / 20 miles per gallon = <<800/20=40>>40 gallons of gas. Then, we figure out how much all the gas will cost. We do this by multiplying the number of gallons Sam needs by how much each gallon costs. So, 40 gallons * $2.50 per gallon = $<<40*2.50=100>>100. So, Sam will need to use $100 to buy all the gas for his trip. #### 100"}

To know how many eggs the chickens lay in a total day, we need to multiply the number of chickens by the number of eggs they each lay. So let's multiply the number of chickens, which is 60, by the number of eggs each chicken lays in a day, which is 6. When we do that, 60 chickens * 6 eggs per chicken = <<60*6=360>>360 total eggs. That means, the chickens lay 360 eggs in a day. #### 360"}
{"text": "We have 200 passengers to carry and one bus can only carry 50 passengers. To find out how many buses we need, we divide the total number of passengers by the number of passengers a single bus can carry. So, we do 200 ÷ 50 = <<200/50=4>>4 buses. That's how many buses we need to carry 200 passengers. #### 4"}
{"text": "Liam had a fun day at a book fair. He paid $9 to get in, bought a Harry Potter book for $15, and a bookmark for $8. He also ate lunch, which cost him $12. At the beginning of the day, he had $50. So, how much money does he have left now? Well, let's add all of his expenses: $9 for the entrance, $15 for the book, $8 for the bookmark, and $12 for lunch. Total money spent is $9 + $15 + $8 + $12 = <<9+15+8+12=44>>44 dollars. Now, he started with $50, and he spent $44, so let's subtract $44 from $50. That's $50 - $44 = <<50-44=6>>6 dollars. So he has $6 left after the book fair. #### 6"}
{"text": "Lily has 24 cupcakes and she wants to share them equally with her 7 friends. This means there are 8 people sharing the cupcakes because we need to count Lily too. To find out how many cupcakes each person will get, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the total number of people. So, 24 cupcakes divided by 8 people equals <<24/8=3>>3 cupcakes per person. #### 3"}
{"text": "Paul has 9 candies and he wants to share them with his 3 friends. To find out how many candies each friend gets, we divide the total number of candies by the number of friends. So, it's 9 candies / 3 friends which equals <<9/3=3>>3 candies for each friend. #### 3"}
{"text": "In this school, there are 9 classes, and each class has 25 students. If every student has 3 pencils, we want to figure out how many pencils are in the entire school. First, we need to find out how many students there are in total. We do this by multiplying the number of classes, 9, by the number of students in each class, 25. So, 9 classes times 25 students each equals <<9*25=225>>225 students. Now that we know there are 225 students, we multiply this number by the number of pencils each student has, which is 3. So, 225 students times 3 pencils each equals <<225*3=675>>675 pencils in the school. #### 675"}
{"text": "We need to find out how much 12 bottles of water would cost. If one bottle costs $2, we simply need to do the multiplication to find out the cost for 12 bottles. So, the calculation would be <<2*12=24>>24. Therefore, 12 bottles of water would cost $24. #### 24"}
{"text": "Billy wants to get a video game that costs $50, but he only has $30. If he earns $5 each day, let's figure out how many days he needs to work to have enough money for his game. First, we need to find out how much more money Billy needs. He needs $50 - $30 = <<50-30=20>>20 more dollars. Now, we know Billy earns $5 every day. So, to know how many days it will take him to earn those $20, we divide $20 by $5. That's $20 / $5 = <<20/5=4>>4 days. So, Billy needs to work 4 more days to buy the video game. #### 4"}
{"text": "A pizza has 8 slices. John eats 2 of those slices. To find out how many slices are left we need to subtract the number of slices John ate from the total number of slices. So, we do 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 slices. So, if John eats 2 slices of pizza, there will be 6 slices left. #### 6"}
{"text": "The dress costs $75 but there is a 20% discount. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 75 * 0.20 = <<75*0.20=15>>$15. So, the discount is $15. Now we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price. So, we do $75 - $15 = <<75-15=60>>$60. So, the dress now costs $60. #### 60"}
